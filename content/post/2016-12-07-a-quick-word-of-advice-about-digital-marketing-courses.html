<p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed an increasing number of people asking me for an <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-digital-marketing-course" target="_blank">opinion on digital marketing courses</a>.</p>
<p>One of the first things I always do when I get asked a question for <a href="https://medium.com/user-research/never-ask-what-they-want-3-better-questions-to-ask-in-user-interviews-aeddd2a2101e#.idaqrm6ah" target="_blank">the second or third time</a> is to take a look at how the number of other people who are asking the same question.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this can be a great way of spotting a trend. Unsurprisingly one of the easiest ways to do this is to run a series of <a href="https://medium.com/@solviddigital/top-4-keyword-research-analysis-tools-overview-guide-14bf4fc9d0b9#.pq9j3938v" target="_blank">keywords</a> through <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=2010-11-06%202016-12-06&amp;q=digital%20marketing%20courses" target="_blank">Google Trends</a>.</p>

<p>I like classes.</p>
<p>Online or offline, there’s just a <a href="https://medium.com/teachersguild/hmw-create-rituals-and-routines-that-establish-a-culture-of-innovation-in-our-classrooms-and-bbde9d872bd9" target="_blank">ritual to them</a>, you know?</p>
<p>You’ve got a new book, a list of conversations to have…a <a href="https://medium.com/@tannerjhunt/tech-skills-required-the-digital-marketing-talent-gap-b037b72d03ff" target="_blank">trajectory of learning</a>. You’ve got introductions, you’ve got <a href="https://medium.com/@CakeHR/top-50-team-building-games-that-your-employees-would-love-to-play-4e35fb8c039b" target="_blank">icebreakers</a>, you’ve got facilitated discussions.</p>
<p>But the one thing you don’t always have is a realistic <a href="https://medium.com/full-stack-marketing/rate-of-learning-the-most-valuable-startup-compensation-56dddc17fa42#.qysm7uco8" target="_blank">rate of learning</a>. You’ve got quarters, you’ve got semesters. On a semester system, you might have courses that stretch <a href="https://medium.com/@jdunns4/why-do-so-many-online-students-quit-8ba4e066aa6d" target="_blank">longer than fifteen weeks</a>.</p>
<p>In the span of time in the screenshot, I can’t find a single 15 week period where the <a href="https://medium.com/@rikwalters/the-evolution-of-digital-marketing-strategy-in-the-enterprise-1b9687a85e09#.oha9332n8" target="_blank">digital marketing landscape</a> didn’t see change in ways that would have required ‘figuring out.’</p>
<p>One of the first pieces of advice I offer to ad operations specialists is to invest a substantial amount of time in reading platform notes.</p>
<p>More mature teams like those behind <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> are investing tremendous amounts of resources in keeping the public up to date on the platform, yet every time I mention say, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2016/11/30/instant-games-closed-beta/" target="_blank">Instant Games</a>, or <a href="https://medium.com/@DigitalDefynd/how-is-voice-search-changing-digital-marketing-8d780f001b6b#.1wjrtvz92" target="_blank">Voice AI</a>, I get blank stares. Yet something tells me six months from now, I’ll be on the receiving end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jurRswnqgSI&amp;list=PLfA33-E9P7FC0AoARnMLvgFgESJe4_Ngs&amp;index=1" target="_blank">Gary Vee video shares</a> and Ad Age articles all about how revolutionary they are.</p>
<p>I get the temptation of a digital marketing course, it’s so easy to fall into the trap of <a href="https://medium.com/@DigitalDefynd/why-do-you-need-to-shift-the-focus-from-digital-marketing-to-marketing-in-the-digital-age-c80759f0b93b#.g4gmfub4a" target="_blank">thinking that you can learn everything one time and have a solid foundation</a> to get updates about.</p>
<p>I can still remember the first time I had a media budget. I spent hours making plans before spending any money. I had models of <a href="https://medium.com/@grapevinelogic/2016-influencer-marketing-budget-trends-7bdf7136a0cf" target="_blank">spending trends</a>, I had projections, I had an idea of who I was targeting, I had a slate of different creative options — I had everything a good plan needed.</p>
<p>I remember queuing up my first batch. I remember coming up with different combinations of text inside of the <a href="http://searchengineland.com/45-characters-adwords-text-ads-now-254659" target="_blank">character limit</a>. I remember driving website clicks with images that had a handful of <a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/how-to-get-tons-of-clicks-on-facebook-ads-images/348986" target="_blank">different colored borders</a>.</p>
<p>And I remember running out of ideas to test within about three days.</p>
<p>Media dollars don’t go quite as far as they did on the mainstream platforms a few years ago, but as near as I’ve found, Facebook media isn’t priced consistently across state lines.</p>
<p>Because of that, there are still plenty of parts of the world where a 30$/month media budget can get you access to 60,000 eyeballs.</p>
<p>When I went to school, it wasn’t uncommon for people to run a blog no one knew about. By the end of college, micro-blogs were everywhere. It seemed like everyone was designing flyers for something.</p>
<p>If resume season is any indication, it gets easier and easier each year to run a side project that rivals the kind of reach regional brands got a few years ago.</p>
<p>It’s not always as straight forward as a digital marketing course online or in a classroom, but getting your hands dirty is one of the fastest ways to learn how this space works.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking for the best digital marketing course out there, you might be able to get more mileage out of just rolling up your sleeves and start working on something.</p>
