<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>One of the greatest misconceptions in the world is that idea that “if you build it they will come.”</p>

<p>Focus on the message, focus on the audience. Make real connections with real people. Share meaningful moments.</p>
<p>Be smart about how you do it, but remember the rules for building a presence are relatively simple — they change at each level of the process. If you can temper your expectations with a bit of patience, you’ll be on the right path.</p>
