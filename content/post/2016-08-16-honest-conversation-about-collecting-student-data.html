<p>I remember when I made my first Yahoo Mail account at 12. I ran into the COPA filter that asked how old I was, and I noticed that if I changed the year, I’d be through and wouldn’t have any trouble signing up.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>We’ve spent a lot more time than I’d like to admit working on, near and around EdTech. One thing that has always bothered me has been the public conversation about student data.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that it’s possible to avoid advertising to students, without a robust targeting schema to identify those students. Once you have a target you can exclude, it’s very easy to make sure that you aren’t collecting data inappropriately.</p>
<p>While mechanisms like the COPA Age Verification promise to fix the problem, they’re not exactly…impenetrable solutions.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I think we’ve got to get better</p>
