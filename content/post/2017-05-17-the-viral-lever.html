<p>I’m going to let you in on a secret that isn’t very well kept.</p>
<p>When you meet a communications professional who tells you “there is no viral lever,” you need to start looking around more.</p>

<p>The trouble is that all too often the people who make the changes that change the world aren’t particularly adept at the art of communicating them.</p>
<p>You can actually make yourself quite potent if you can learn to walk between the cultures a little. Sometimes this means you’re an arts kid who sits down and learns calculus. Other times it can mean taking a break from questioning the futility of memorized reference values to enjoy an obscure text. Walking down the middle of the path can take you to some truly fascinating places.</p>

<p>When you are the sort of person who sets out to make a thing, it is rather easy to fall into the trap of believing that the world is an infinite sea of possibilities.</p>
<p>The trouble is that just because something is bigger than you can perceive doesn’t mean that it isn’t also finite.</p>

<p>One of the greatest advancements in this sort of work has come of the world of network <a href="http://www.usma.edu/nsc/SiteAssets/SitePages/Publications/shakarianEyrePaulo-heurViralMktTip_main.pdf" target="_blank">engineering</a>, and while I could bore you with specious detail, it would be far more interesting to think of the ways in which you encounter media throughout your life.</p>
<p>Before you decide on something, you’re likely to send it to one or perhaps a few different people.</p>

<p>Your relationships exist across contexts. Each from a different life you have lead. When a message propagates across those spheres, <a href="http://www.usma.edu/nsc/SiteAssets/SitePages/Publications/shakarian_cirTip.pdf" target="_blank">you pay attention to it</a>.</p>
<p>You aren’t the only person who does this — we all seem to.</p>
<p>It isn’t magical, it’s just math.</p>
