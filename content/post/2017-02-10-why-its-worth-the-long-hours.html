<p>I still remember one of the first nights it occurred to me that I’d need to stay up and watch how an ad served.</p>
<p>We had been experimenting with a few different global audiences for an App.</p>
<p>One particular audience segment was performing particularly well throughout what would for me, have been the overnight hours.</p>
<p>I needed to measure comments at the same time that I was making changes. There wasn’t any way around it but to power through.</p>
<p>I got together some supplies, queued up some music and movies to play in the background and started combing through data.</p>
<p>As my ads served I thought about what I had always been told about advertising internationally.</p>
<p>There’s a really unfair bit of bias against it, and while I hadn’t thought about it at the time, some of it may have been born out of reaction to the difficulties in tracking verified views.</p>
<p>To be honest, that’s still a challenge, but it isn’t an insurmountable one. Not anymore.</p>
<p>As the results trickled in, I allowed myself a slight indulgence and spent a little longer examining the profiles of the potential users we were reaching.</p>
<p>I watched as users would engage with an ad. Some would have a positive comment, others would tap like, still others would download the widget.</p>
<p>When I could, I spent a little time looking at profiles.</p>
<p>I saw people with lives that were worth knowing about.</p>
<p>I saw people with lives I’d rather not have known about.</p>
<p>They stay a story should have some conflict to it, and this is about the part where I would throw some in. But the truth is, there wasn’t anything conflicting about watching this.</p>
<p>Whenever we start working on a new project, I try to spend some time watching profiles.</p>
<p>I take flack from our team for it all the time and the truth is they aren’t wrong: it’s wildly inefficient.</p>
<p>But every time I find it hard to get through a day advertising, I come back to those streams of profiles. Every time I can’t figure out why one adset is working great and another is falling or need to pin down just which element of a program is driving results, I go back to those profiles.</p>
<p>Because the truth is some of us didn’t get into this to shill, and sometimes watching the people is the best way to remember that.</p>
