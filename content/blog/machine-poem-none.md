![](content/assets/karl-taylor_machine-poems.jpg)_I've done a little more fiddling, here's another. Miss the first one?_ 

# none

it wasn't quite relatable,

we are all distracted by produce.

they walked through 

an examination of the phrase 

when applied to all.

The importance of such a nocturnal hour.

oh, the significance of those sorts of letters to a kid my age.

Human intervention is absent from the screen a-front my fingertips.

they spend a lot more.

no, once someone tried to teach me something once.
