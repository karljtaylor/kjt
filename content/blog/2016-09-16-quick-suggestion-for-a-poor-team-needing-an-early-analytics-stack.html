<p>I think all too often, startups put off putting in basic tracking capabilities until they feel like they can afford a solution on the level of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud.html" target="_blank">Adobe Marketing Cloud</a> — or in the medium term <a href="https://medium.com/u/8732e73183e5" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>.</p>
<p>I think if I were just getting started on a project this is the flow I’d use. (It’s actually the flow we’re using on our team’s branded properties right now.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://medium.com/u/6e946b6a2866" target="_blank">Segment</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I really shouldn’t be so shameless, but if I were going to deploy a tag on an early stage team (say an early website) I wouldn’t want to have to revisit updating my site each time I discovered a new capability I wanted to play with.</p>
<p>You’re likely going to be doing a lot of that in the beginning. It’s a good idea to get started in a way that you’re going to find useful as you go on.</p>
<p>(You could also definitely wrestle with Google tag manager. <a href="https://medium.com/u/109d780a5963" target="_blank">9 Clouds</a> has a solid primer going on <a href="https://medium.com/@9clouds/the-complete-guide-to-google-tag-manager-abridged-e8ce8a3e0eed#.wnkx2fzic" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>2. Integrate The Properties You’re Currently Using</p>
<p>It’s likely that you’ve got a Facebook page, and probably a Twitter account. You should take the opportunity to get signed up at <a href="http://business.facebook.com" target="_blank">business.facebook.com</a> and follow their directions to setup a pixel. (I like <a href="https://medium.com/retargetapp-shopify-app/the-ultimate-guide-to-facebook-retargeting-dbbbdf138996#.etrrltzcm" target="_blank">this guide</a> from <a href="https://medium.com/u/e727d044eabe" target="_blank">Pavel Matvienko</a>)</p>
<p>You’ll find that the fine folks at <a href="https://medium.com/u/6e946b6a2866" target="_blank">Segment</a> have a number of delightful guides that should work you through updating the settings for each integration — which in the short term will save you from having to make additional changes to your website.</p>
<p>You don’t have to go crazy here, because you’ll find you’re in a plan that’s priced by MTUs, which if you’re finding this advice useful, you’re a ways off from having a big number of.</p>
<p>3. Website? <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>. App? <a href="http://mixpanel.com" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a>.</p>
<p>In both cases, you should settle pretty near to the free tier — it takes a while to outgrow.</p>
<p>If you want to drill a little deeper, here’s a <a href="https://medium.com/saas-user-onboarding-resources/how-to-hack-your-analytics-with-segment-io-500acfc32254#.vjxawm19d" target="_blank">good introduction to Segment</a> from <a href="https://medium.com/u/dbb26c48469" target="_blank">Francois de Fitte</a>.</p>
