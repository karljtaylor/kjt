 I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard some version of that idea.

 Growing up, I remember keeping a list of each time I ran into it. I don’t know that I kept it up, but I do know I first heard it as a shoddy explanation from a caricature of a public school art teacher.

 I normally write slightly longer posts, but I just wanted to take a moment to share one thought.

 I think this sentence was meaningless. It was code for “I don’t like your thing and you should feel bad.”

 It is important to remember that in today’s communications landscape it is possible to know precisely who you are communicating with and how they feel about it.

 Today, millions of people across the world post their lives, waiting for someone to listen.

 As a communications professional, it’s your job to be that person.

 That’s all.

 Listen.
