I've always been fascinated by the idea that with a little bit of time you can actually accomplish quite a few things on your own that really even just a few years ago would have taken either a handful of people or a lot more time than it does today.

To play around with this idea, I wanted to make a quick video using the things I could find at my desk.

here is the result:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKgthAuKSzw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's not great, by any means, but it was a fun little afternoon project, and a good reminder of just how much easier some of these production workflows have really gotten. There's no reason why a small project can't have video. It's just gotten that much easier.

For the curious: I used the [MTSR](http://mtsr-app.com/) app to capture and (crudely) mix a few audio tracks I recorded. I captured the footage using a tripod and [Stop Motion Studio](https://www.cateater.com/utm_source=karljtaylor.com) Props came from [disney](https://www.shopdisney.com/?CMP=karljtaylor.com), [mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/?utm_source=karljtaylor.com) and of course, [coke](https://us.coca-cola.com/store/?utm_source=karljtaylor.com)
