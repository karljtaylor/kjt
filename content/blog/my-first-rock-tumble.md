# My First Rock Tumble

I've been trying really hard to do a better job about taking time away from work to do things that don't have anything to do with marketing or....content creation, and to be honest that's been really hard. I've always really liked rocks, and so I decided to try my hand at rock tumbling.

There's a ton of great content online, and I really enjoyed [Michigan Rock's](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichiganRocks?utm_source=karljtaylor.com&utm_medium=article+link&utm_campaign=first_rock_tumble&utm_term=michigan_rocks_channel&utm_content=article_link) content on YouTube in particular.

I decided, based on that great content, that I would go ahead and start off with the [hobby version of the Nat Geo Rock Tumbler](https://amzn.to/38aRECM), and then I would decide based on how it went if I was going to stick with this or not. I did go ahead and use their suggestions for [better grit](https://amzn.to/3PFYAsm), though, and have been running things much, much longer than the directions that came with the kit suggested.

Here's a video of the very beginning of the process:

After that, I ran things through the coarse grit a few more times.

Here's what the rocks looked like after they got the stage two grit.

and this is what the rocks looked like after they had a round of stage three grit in the rock tumbler.

I'll update this post when I finish up the polish stage, it shouldn't be too much longer now.
