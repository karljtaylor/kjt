Those of you who follow us closely, know that for the past week, we’ve working on a study of the return on investment associated with the use of Pokemon Lures.

 We’ve logged more than 35 hours of playtime — and we’ve spent most of it tracking other players.

 Over the next few days, we’ll share some of the best practices we’ve collected as well as some of the raw foot traffic data for the collection of PokeStops we had access to.

 We’re going to need more data that we have to make stable ROI calculations for a market outside of Denver. That’s why we want to make sure as many people as possible have an opportunity to contribute to this growing data set.

 I’ve set up a google form that I’ll be monitoring throughout the day as we collect more field results.

 We expect to start releasing some preliminary findings by mid-week.

 If you’d like to help, here’s a link to the form.

 NOTE: This post is very old, and I am very unlikely to check that form :)
