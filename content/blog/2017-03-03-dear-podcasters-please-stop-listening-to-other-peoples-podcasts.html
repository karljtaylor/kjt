<h4>A Suggestion From Someone Who Listens To Way Too Many Podcasts</h4>

<p>In the past week, I’ve listened to seven different podcasters lament changes in audiences, downloads or support metrics. The anguish reminded me of the way I felt when, after salivating over <a href="https://twitter.com/jpuppet?lang=en" target="_blank">Jesse Freund’s</a> “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/08/dl-players/" target="_blank">The MP3 Players</a>,” and finally saving up over what had felt like an entire three lifetimes enough hard-earned cash to pick up my very first, I discovered most audio files were lousy fits.</p>
<p>(I should note here by way of tangent that <a href="https://twitter.com/wwwdotandrew?lang=en" target="_blank">Andrew Williams</a> recently tried to resurrect one of these in an piece I wish had been called “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/diamond-rio-pmp300-mp3-player-today/" target="_blank">The Diamond In The Rough</a>.”)</p>
<p>I wanted to listen, but in 1999 fiddling around on my Compaq computer, it meant I had to start learning about audio file compression.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>It was a lot easier than I expected it to have been. Everywhere I looked online, the same people who were making the shows I wanted to listen to could be found talking about how they did it.</p>
<p>If you were quick with a search engine, you could find the specific tool or apparatus they were talking about, and more often than not start playing with it yourself.</p>
<p>IRC channels sprung up, there were blogs. I remember there being more to read than anyone could, and there being real feeling of excitement around the idea of what I think people were calling downloadable Internet Radio.</p>
<p>(For the record, yes this is a horribly revisionist history and yes there are great archival efforts like <a href="http://That%20culture%20of%20sharing%20persists%20to%20today." target="_blank">All Of The Podcasts</a> that are amazing and worth checking out.)</p>
<p>That culture of sharing persists to today.</p>
<p>It isn’t unique to podcasters by any means, but of all of the different communities of content producers online, I’ve got to admit that I’ve always noticed that when I make a list of “best person to listen to about X,” a lot of the time, it’s a podcaster.</p>
<p>That’s why as I was hearing the very real anguish that surround the contemporary peculiarities of podcasting, I couldn’t help but remember a story I had read a long time ago.</p>
<p>I am in the uncomfortable position of needing to evoke an idea from one history’s <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/reminder-rudyard-kipling-was-a-racist-fuck-and-the-jun-1771044121" target="_blank">best spoken lesser beings</a>, through it should be noted “<a href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kipling/rudyard/many/chapter6.html" target="_blank">The Finest Story In The World</a>,” is most often rightly avoided for its problematic account of a reincarnation of sorts. Nevertheless, I afford myself a bit of authorial luxury to highlight:</p>
<p>I think this portion gets missed.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t care about writing things any more. I want to read.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the story, the more Charlie reads the less he’s able to tell his own story.</p>
<p>Life intervenes, things come up and he always seem have an interest in chasing the best the world has to offer.</p>
<p>When you’re building content it’s natural to look at what everyone else is doing. You try to out-engineer their successes. You try to learn from their failures.</p>
<p>But before too long, you end up producing content that you really can’t tell apart.</p>
<p>Trying to keep what you consume from influencing your work is a losing battle, but making sure you work in silos can help you short circuit the inevitable bias towards what already exists.</p>
