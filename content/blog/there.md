I'm happy to have a new site up!

I haven't really bothered to go through the process of updating links and making sure old content is suuuuupppper readable on this new site. I know that means a few things are really broken, if you want to read them again, let me know!

In the meantime, take a look around!

Might not be too much to see, but I'll take care of that soon!
