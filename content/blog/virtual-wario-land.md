**Virtual Wario Land**

I've always loved the Virtual Boy version of Wario Land, but I only ever got to play it for a few moments at a friends house when I was younger. I was really glad to get it working inside of my Occulus Go a few weeks ago, and caught this wario land gameplay footage that I thought I'd share.
