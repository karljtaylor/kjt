I spent a lot of time earlier this year reflecting on what I thought might be some [good goals](https://blog.karljtaylor.com/blog/personal-okrs-2019/). I'd always read that the ranks of 'high throughput' readers was kind of [cool club](https://www.blinkist.com/magazine/posts/most-ceos-read-60-books-per-year "Blinkist Survey Of High Throughput Readers"), and I knew that for me, listening was one the fastest ways to consume new information. In 2019, I managed to read something like [31 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/38299672). I decided that this year, I would try to read that sixty books I was always hearing average CEOs read.

2. That's so many!
3.
