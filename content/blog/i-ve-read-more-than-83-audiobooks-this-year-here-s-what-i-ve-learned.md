# I've Read More Than 83 Audiobooks This Year, Here's What I've Learned

<img>

I spent a lot of time earlier this year reflecting on what I thought might be some [good goals](https://blog.karljtaylor.com/blog/personal-okrs-2019/). I'd always read that the ranks of 'high throughput' readers were kind of [cool club](https://www.blinkist.com/magazine/posts/most-ceos-read-60-books-per-year "Blinkist Survey Of High Throughput Readers"), and I knew that for me, listening was one the fastest ways to consume new information. In 2019, I managed to read something like [31 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/38299672). I decided that this year, I would try to read that sixty books I was always hearing average CEOs read.

To be completely honest, I think that statistic is 1) nonsense 2) originated in an old MentorBox ad.

I think I've heard four criticisms about reading this much:

1. That's so many!
2. OK but do you actually retain anything?
3. That's so many, are any of them any good?
4. OK but that must mean spending a fortune on audiobooks.

So far this year, I've read more than [83 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/38299672), and I suspect I'll probably get a little further before the end of the year. I wanted to share a few thoughts on the above questions, and a couple of tips I've picked up along the way.

### That's Too Many Books

It probably is, but the truth is, there's likely [more than 1,000,000 new books published every year](https://www.theifod.com/how-many-new-books-are-published-each-year-and-other-related-books-facts/). That's a lot of really great ideas no one is ever going to read. I like ideas like that, and I've yet to find a better system for aggregating deep insights than books. There's so much learning just hiding, tucked between pages, waiting for you to discover. 

As an undergraduate English major, I frequently made the mistake of taking six classes a semester. Each class would have a reading list of about 10-15 books, and an expectation that students would read somewhere in the neighborhood of 6-12 of them. I frequently found myself in the unfortunate position of having to cover a lot of ground quickly. That lead me to become fascinated with the idea of speed reading, and memory. I played around with [ideas like this one](https://www.lifehack.org/640273/the-only-way-to-remember-everything-you-have-read), and spent a lot of time thinking about ways to get out of my own head and read more efficiently.

I'd like to think I learned some helpful techniques during that time, but the truth is, by the time I was through with school, I was seriously considering never reading another book ever again. I was tired of it. I was tired of the ritual, and how for some people, the process of reading was more important than the _why_ of reading. Looking back, I think there was a lot of noise, and that noise was overwhelming and tiring. 

Reading can be a hard habit to pick up because in many ways it requires you to be stationary. It's actually one of the things I've come to love about digital books--be it in audio or text formats. It's easier to make reading something you do when you have a moment. 

Over the last year, I've found myself slowly reading books of poems on my phone between meetings, and exploring an audiobook or two a day when I don't have a lot going on and don't feel like leaving the house. Sometimes I feel like audiobooks fill a void in my life that I used to fill with podcasts, and I find that when I approach reading that way, it's easier to fit in amongst the mix of media I'm already consuming. 

That approach helped me to get over my 'reading fatigue.' By taking it less seriously, and by mixing up the format, I was able to find a place for books in my life again--but it really didn't look the same. The first book I read after that long break was Tarzan. 

I decided that in order to reach my goal, I would be as charitable with my definition of 'book' as possible. I defined a book as anything that was published as a book. I've read collections of poems, and I've read a few children's stories. I decided that for me, maximizing my rate of learning was my goal, and the best way to do that was to increase the number of different voices I was learning from. 

There are different reasons to read, and this goal might not work for you. I think the most important part is to find your own goal. After you've done that, it's funny how quickly the rest comes into focus.

### OK, But Do You Actually Retain Anything?

* Anecdote about memory being a lot more powerful than we give it credit for
* Habit of taking a note, or trying to find an immediate conversation on a topic
* leveraging the internet to find communities where the topics at hand are being explored
* taking the time to 'make an idea your own' by looking for a situation where it can apply
* reading more than one thing at once is actually great for synergy (it might be rough on comprehension if you don't keep notes)
* clips and other note taking hacks are awesome--if you can remember to use them!

### That's So Many, Are Any Of Them Any Good?

* Lesson about writing a bad first draft when writing, and how the same principle is probably true of reading
* Exploration of places to get good ideas, places to get bad ideas
* Paying attention to what authors of good books like
* Balancing the time you have with the amount you're reading, and a sense of accomplishment.

### OK But Audiobooks Are Expensive

* Be willing to find audiobooks in strange places (stories.audible, youtube, spotify, apple music)
* Buy an audible subscription, pay attention to your cost per credit
* Sign up for scribd. It's not really unlimited, but you'll be able to read 2-3 audiobooks a month.
* If you find a book you might have to buy outright, pay attention to the cost of your book on the iBooks, Google Play Books, and Audible member price. These prices almost always compete.
* Platforms like Chirp or Audiobooks.com occasionally have great deals.
* Your local library likely has an RBDigital or Overdrive subscription.

## Conclusion

* I was really surprised by how much I could read
* I was even more surprised by how quickly I was able to explore completely new areas
* I've found myself making plans for what I read when, and why, which is something I haven't done in years.
