# I've Read More Than 83 Audiobooks This Year, Here's What I've Learned

<img>

I spent a lot of time earlier this year reflecting on what I thought might be some [good goals](https://blog.karljtaylor.com/blog/personal-okrs-2019/). I'd always read that the ranks of 'high throughput' readers was kind of [cool club](https://www.blinkist.com/magazine/posts/most-ceos-read-60-books-per-year "Blinkist Survey Of High Throughput Readers"), and I knew that for me, listening was one the fastest ways to consume new information. In 2019, I managed to read something like [31 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/38299672). I decided that this year, I would try to read that sixty books I was always hearing average CEOs read.

To be completely honest, I think DHH is probably right that this statistic is 1) nonsense 2) originated in an old MentorBox ad.

I think I've heard four criticisms about reading this much:

1. That's so many!
2. OK but do you actually retain anything?
3. That's so many, are any of them any good?
4. OK but that must mean spending a fortune on audiobooks. 

So far this year, I've read more than [83 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/38299672), and I suspect I'll probably get a little further before the end of the year. I wanted to share a few thoughts on the above questions, and a couple tips I've picked up along the way. 

### That's Too Many Books 

It probably is, but the truth is, there's likely [more than 1,000,000 new books published every year](https://www.theifod.com/how-many-new-books-are-published-each-year-and-other-related-books-facts/). 

As an undergraduate English major, I frequently made the mistake of taking six classes a semester. Each class would have a reading list of about 10-15 books, and an expectation that students would read somewhere in the neighborhood of 6-12 of them. I frequently found myself in the unfortunate position of having to cover a lot of ground quickly. That lead me to become fascinated with the idea of speed reading, and memory. I played around with [ideas like this one](https://www.lifehack.org/640273/the-only-way-to-remember-everything-you-have-read), and spent a lot of time thinking about ways to get out of my own head and read more efficiently. 

* How did you get over the fatigue of 'having to read' too much? 
* How did you approach reading again after that struggle? 
* Why did you decide to take this on? 
* How did you decide what counted as a book? 
* What value can someone else take from this experience? 

### OK, But Do You Actually Retain Anything? 

* Anecdote about memory being a lot more powerful than we give it credit for 
* Habit of taking a note, or trying to find an immediate conversation on a topic
* leveraging the internet to find communities where the topics at hand are being explored
* taking the time to 'make an idea your own' by looking for a situation where it can apply 
* reading more than one thing at once is actually great for synergy (it might be rough on comprehension if you don't keep notes) 
* clips and other note taking hacks are awesome--if you can remember to use them! 

### That's So Many, Are Any Of Them Any Good? 

* Lesson about writing a bad first draft when writing, and how the same principle is probably true of reading 
* Exploration of places to get good ideas, places to get bad ideas 
* Paying attention to what authors of good books like
* Balancing the time you have with the amount you're reading, and a sense of accomplishment. 

### OK But Audiobooks Are Expensive 

* Be willing to find audiobooks in strange places (stories.audible, youtube, spotify, apple music) 
* Buy an audible subscription, pay attention to your cost per credit
* Sign up for scribd. It's not really unlimited, but you'll be able to read 2-3 audiobooks a month. 
* If you find a book you might have to buy outright, pay attention to the cost of your book on the iBooks, Google Play Books, and Audible member price. These prices almost always compete. 
* Platforms like Chirp or Audiobooks.com occasionally have great deals. 
* Your local library likely has an RBDigital or Overdrive subscription. 

## Conclusion 

* I was really surprised by how much I could read
* I was even more surprised by how quickly I was able to explore completely new areas
* I've found myself making plans for what I read when, and why, which is something I haven't done in years.
