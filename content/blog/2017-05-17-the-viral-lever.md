 I’m going to let you in on a secret that isn’t very well kept.

 When you meet a communications professional who tells you “there is no viral lever,” you need to start looking around more.

 The trouble is that all too often the people who make the changes that change the world aren’t particularly adept at the art of communicating them.

 You can actually make yourself quite potent if you can learn to walk between the cultures a little. Sometimes this means you’re an arts kid who sits down and learns calculus. Other times it can mean taking a break from questioning the futility of memorized reference values to enjoy an obscure text. Walking down the middle of the path can take you to some truly fascinating places.

 When you are the sort of person who sets out to make a thing, it is rather easy to fall into the trap of believing that the world is an infinite sea of possibilities.

 The trouble is that just because something is bigger than you can perceive doesn’t mean that it isn’t also finite.

 One of the greatest advancements in this sort of work has come of the world of network [engineering](http://www.usma.edu/nsc/SiteAssets/SitePages/Publications/shakarianEyrePaulo-heurViralMktTip_main.pdf), and while I could bore you with specious detail, it would be far more interesting to think of the ways in which you encounter media throughout your life.

 Before you decide on something, you’re likely to send it to one or perhaps a few different people.

 Your relationships exist across contexts. Each from a different life you have lead. When a message propagates across those spheres, [you pay attention to it](http://www.usma.edu/nsc/SiteAssets/SitePages/Publications/shakarian_cirTip.pdf).

 You aren’t the only person who does this — we all seem to.

 It isn’t magical, it’s just math.
