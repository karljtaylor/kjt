# I Spent A Month In The Hospital

I guess I was right that my stomach acting up. To be honest, I hadn't even noticed, and by the time I finally got in to get seen, things got worse quickly. 

I spent the last month or so in [St. Joseph's Hospital](https://www.sclhealth.org/locations/saint-joseph-hospital/?utm_source=karljtaylor.com&utm_medium=article+link&utm_campaign=month_in_the_hospital&utm_term=hospital_link&utm_content=article_link) here in Denver. 

I don't have a ton of time to share all the details here, but I want to take a moment to thank everyone who has reached out, your support has really meant a lot to me.

Here I am waiting for a procedure...terrified. 

The one nice thing, the sunrises in the mornings have been amazing.

I've also really taken to enjoying a cup of tea each evening on the balcony. It's remarkable just how meaningful those small moments have become for me.
