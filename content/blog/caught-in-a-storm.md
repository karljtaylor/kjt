# Caught In A Storm

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karljtaylor/kjt/blog/content/assets/karljtaylor-i-want-to-remember.png)

I couldn't think of a better way to commemorate surviving the last few moths than spending a few weeks with my parents on their annual trip to run in the Disney World Marathon Weekend. 

It was my first trip since the surgery, and the first time I've taken any time off really since the pandemic started two years ago. I was pretty apprehensive on both fronts. I've got nothing but wonderful things to say about Disney's Disability Access Service, which really made my time in the parks with my family a lot more...manageable, but when it came to the cruise, I really wasn't sure what to expect. 

The truth is, it went a lot better than I feared. 

On the last night, I spent a little time a lone in the thermal suite, and as I was reflecting on what a journey the last few months had been, a storm picked up. I decided I wasn't going to let it bother me, and went right back to relaxing.

After a few moments, I realized that there was probably a pretty powerful lesson hiding in that experience, so I recorded a few of my thoughts, and I wanted to share them with y'all. Apologies for the audio quality...it...was windy.
